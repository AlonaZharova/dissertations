### Abstract:
The impacts of climate change become more and more noticeable. New technologies can help to increase energy efficiency in private households. So far, the consumer behaviour regarding energy consumption has been considered sparsely. Research shows that the energy consumption behaviour has a high impact on the energy consumption.  
Therefore, this master thesis addresses the question which behavioural strategies can be pursued to increase energy efficiency in private households. Based on psychological and socio-demographic data a machine learning model which predicts recommendation messages for the users is trained. This gives an example how promising nudging strategies can be used to change energy consumption behaviour.

For this thesis the following datasets are needed: 
acorn_details.csv
informations_households.csv
daily_dataset.csv

There are two .ipynb files: 
1. Preprocessing_and_Plots.ipynb
2. Preparation_target_variables_and_modelling.ipynb

For the second file a pickle (preprocessed_merged_Acorn.pkl) with the preprocessed data from the first file can be used
